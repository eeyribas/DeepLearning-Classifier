# DeepLearning-Classifier
Deep Learning Classification includes related applications. In two applications, classification is performed using different trained models. The code is written in Python. The applications are:

1. CatDogTraining-1: This is a Deep Learning Classification application. To run the code, please install the tensorflow and pillow libraries. The libraries are not included in the repository due to their large size. The models used in the classification are explained in the images CatDogTraining-Model-Image-1.jpeg and CatDogTraining-Model-Image-2.jpeg.

2. CatDogTraining-2: This is a Deep Learning Classification application. To run the code, please install the tensorflow, pandas, and opencv-python libraries. The libraries are not included in the repository due to their large size. The models used in the classification are explained in the images CatDog-Model-Image-1.jpeg and CatDog-Model-Image-2.jpeg.
