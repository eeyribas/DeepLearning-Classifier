# DeepLearning-Classifier
Contains applications related to Deep Learning Classification. The two applications perform classification using different trained models. The applications are as follows:

1. CatDogTraining-1: Deep Learning Classification application. To run the code, the tensorflow and pillow libraries must be installed. The libraries are not included in the repository due to their large size. 
The models used in the classification are shown in the images CatDogTraining-Model-Image-1.jpeg and CatDogTraining-Model-Image-2.jpeg.

2. CatDogTraining-2: Deep Learning Classification application. To run the code, the tensorflow, pandas, and opencv-python libraries must be installed. The libraries are not included in the repository due to their large size. 
The models used in the classification are shown in the images CatDog-Model-Image-1.jpeg and CatDog-Model-Image-2.jpeg.
